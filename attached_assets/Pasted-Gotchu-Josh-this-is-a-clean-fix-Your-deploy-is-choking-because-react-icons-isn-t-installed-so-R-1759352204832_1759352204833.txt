Gotchu, Josh — this is a clean fix. Your deploy is choking because react-icons isn’t installed, so Rollup/Vite can’t resolve react-icons/si. Do these steps and you’ll be green.

1) Install the missing dep

In the Replit Shell:

npm i react-icons

(If you use pnpm: pnpm add react-icons)

2) Add it to package.json (so Replit’s build env has it)

Make sure react-icons is in dependencies (not devDependencies):

{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-icons": "^5.2.1"
  }
}

If it was missing, add it and commit. Replit will re-install on publish.

3) Verify the import in FormatSelector.tsx

This is the correct pattern for Simple Icons:

// FormatSelector.tsx
import { SiTwitter, SiTiktok, SiYoutube } from "react-icons/si"; // works once react-icons is installed

Avoid default imports like import SiTwitter from "react-icons/si" — named imports only.

4) Clear any stale lock/cache and rebuild (if the fail persists)

Sometimes Replit caches a bad state:

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml
npm i
npm run build

5) (Optional) Make bundling fail fast on bad imports

If Vite seemed to “warn” but not stop the build earlier, tighten config:

vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    // Fail hard on unresolved deps:
    rollupOptions: {
      onwarn(warning, warn) {
        if (warning.code === "UNRESOLVED_IMPORT") {
          throw new Error(`Unresolved import: ${warning.source ?? warning.id}`);
        }
        warn(warning);
      }
    }
  },
  // Helps TypeScript + Node-style resolution in Vite 5+
  resolve: { dedupe: ["react", "react-dom"] }
});

tsconfig.json (just sanity check these):

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler", // or "NodeNext" if you prefer
    "target": "ES2020",
    "types": ["vite/client", "node"]
  }
}

6) Replit specifics (nice-to-have)
	•	Ensure Node ≥ 18 in package.json to match Replit’s builders:

{ "engines": { "node": ">=18" } }

	•	If you’re using a custom replit.nix, confirm it includes Node 18+.

Quick checklist (do these in order)
	1.	npm i react-icons
	2.	Confirm react-icons is in dependencies
	3.	Use named imports from "react-icons/si" in FormatSelector.tsx
	4.	Nuke lock + reinstall if it still fails
	5.	(Optional) Add the Vite onwarn guard so broken imports kill the build instantly

Ship it. And yeah — “other platforms made the rules; you burned the rulebook.” This fix gets your deploy back on track so FUN can keep flexing. 🚀
