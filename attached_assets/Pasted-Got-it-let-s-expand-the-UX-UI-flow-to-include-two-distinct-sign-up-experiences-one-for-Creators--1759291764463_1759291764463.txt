Got it — let’s expand the UX/UI flow to include two distinct sign-up experiences: one for Creators (Stars) and one for Fanz (fans). These flows should feel parallel but differentiated, reinforcing the brand’s creator-first ethos while making it effortless for fans to engage.

⸻

⭐ Creator (Star) Sign-Up Flow

Creators are the backbone, so their onboarding should feel premium, empowering, and supportive.
	1.	Welcome Screen
	•	Bold CTA: “Claim Your Star Power”
	•	Quick highlight of benefits: 100% earnings, content ownership, community tools.
	2.	Account Creation
	•	Social logins (Google, Apple, Twitter/X).
	•	Email + password option.
	3.	Profile Setup
	•	Display name, stage name, pronouns, avatar/banner upload.
	•	Niche/tags selection (helps match with the right fanz).
	4.	Verification & Compliance
	•	ID verification flow (seamless photo + selfie match).
	•	Age/consent forms with progress tracker (clear + supportive tone).
	5.	Monetization Setup
	•	Link payout method (PayPal, bank, crypto, etc.).
	•	One-tap preview: “Here’s how much you’ll earn (100% yours).”
	6.	Creator Dashboard Intro
	•	Guided tour with tooltips: upload button, live features, fan interaction.
	•	Micro-celebration animation when they publish their first post.

👥 Fanz Sign-Up Flow

Fanz should feel welcome, safe, and instantly connected.
	1.	Welcome Screen
	•	Tagline like: “Discover. Connect. Support. Your new world of creators awaits.”
	•	Tease featured creators (blurred previews until sign-up).
	2.	Account Creation
	•	Simple: Social logins or email + password.
	•	Ask for birthday (age verification).
	3.	Personalization Onboarding
	•	Quick swiping/liking quiz: choose interests, niches, tags.
	•	Output: personalized feed ready to go.
	4.	Payment Setup (Optional, Skippable)
	•	Light nudge: “Add a card to tip or subscribe instantly.”
	•	Show security badges + privacy reassurance.
	5.	Fan Dashboard Intro
	•	Feed walkthrough: discover creators, follow, interact.
	•	Highlight quick actions: tip, DM, react, share.

🔄 Unified UX Principles
	•	Consistent branding: Both flows should feel FUN-branded but tone-shifted → Stars get bold/empowering vibes, Fanz get playful/discovery-driven vibes.
	•	Seamless cross-navigation: Single account system → a user could upgrade from Fanz → Creator with just a few clicks.
	•	Progressive onboarding: Don’t overwhelm. Unlock features as users explore (e.g., unlock fan tiers after first follow, unlock advanced analytics after first 5 posts).

🔥 Imagine this: the Creator and Fan journeys mirror each other, so the platform always feels like a two-sided ecosystem, ccnot just another paywall site. That’s retention gold.
